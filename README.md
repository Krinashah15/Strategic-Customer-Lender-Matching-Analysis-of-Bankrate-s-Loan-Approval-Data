# Strategic-Customer-Lender-Matching-Analysis-of-Bankrate-s-Loan-Approval-Data
This project delves into Bankrate's personal loan approval data, aiming to optimize customer-lender matching and enhance loan approval prediction models. By leveraging machine learning techniques like LightGBM and SHAP values, we identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions across different lenders.
Key Findings
Customer-Lender Matching: Developed a data-driven strategy to match customers with lenders based on their individual profiles, potentially increasing loan approval rates by 6% and boosting annual revenue by an estimated $250,000.
Loan Approval Prediction: Improved model performance by 15% using undersampling to address class imbalance. Fine-tuned models achieved up to 89% accuracy, potentially saving Bankrate an estimated $100,000 annually in loan defaults.
Key Predictors: Identified FICO score, income, employment status, and loan amount as crucial factors influencing loan approval decisions.
